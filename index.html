            <div class="section1-description" id="section1Description">We are able to traverse the modern age digitally and connect with others wherever their location might be. Video calling technology has significantly changed our understanding of relationships. 
                You might not know the person texting/chatting you might be remote or at a far distance. How might technology affect your friendships, good or bad?
                With the ability to connect to anyone immediately, we can enact friendships and keep up to date without meeting in person. These are connections that do not require physical appearances. 
                Are you conscious that you are forming a friendship online by texting someone you don’t know?

                The digital world may be far from us, ever expanding. People too may seem long distance.
                But we close the gap and form friendships that seem closer than you think. Feeling as if we are right next to one another.

            <div class="grid3-paragraph1">Days fly by and you are still connected with the friends you knew in the past. Friendships are still stable despite being across the world from the people you hold close. 
                You take the time to text and share meaningful updates with your contacts. Wherever you carry your device, you are carrying your preserved online life. 
                Given your free time how do you respond to others digitally? Does being long distance impact your response?

            <div class="grid3-paragraph2">Isolation gives freedom, independence and a sense of release. Does isolation impact you positively? 
                We are given time to ourselves but at the same time can fulfill our social batteries at any moment. Connecting 
                digitally enhances our lives. Isolation can birth physical connection.

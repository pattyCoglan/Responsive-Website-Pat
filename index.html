            <div class="section1-description" id="section1Description">We are able to traverse the modern age digitally and connect with others wherever their location might be. Video calling technology has significantly changed our understanding of relationships. 
                You might not know the person texting/chatting you might be remote or at a far distance. How might technology affect your friendships, good or bad?
                With the ability to connect to anyone immediately, we can enact friendships and keep up to date without meeting in person. These are connections that do not require physical appearances. 
                Are you conscious that you are forming a friendship online by texting someone you donâ€™t know?

            <div class="grid1-paragraph">Any form of relationships can be preserved by exchanging contacts. This is a permanent solution to converse with each other at any given time.
                Preserving these details effectively gives you the opportunity to text, call or video chat with another in the future within seconds. Preservation comes with purpose. To not lose that connection.

            <div class="grid2-paragraph">We have redefined relationship comfort-ability with the age of technology. 
                The digital world may be far from us, ever expanding. People too may seem long distance.
                But we close the gap and form friendships that seem closer than you think. Feeling as if we are right next to one another.

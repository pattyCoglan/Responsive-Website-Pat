            <div class="section1-description" id="section1Description">We are able to traverse the modern age digitally and connect with others wherever their location might be. Video calling technology has significantly changed our understanding of relationships. 
                You might not know the person texting/chatting you might be remote or at a far distance. How might technology affect your friendships, good or bad?
                With the ability to connect to anyone immediately, we can enact friendships and keep up to date without meeting in person. These are connections that do not require physical appearances. 
                Are you conscious that you are forming a friendship online by texting someone you donâ€™t know?
